  <h2>How To Play</h2>
  <p>The goal is simple, make a lot of money. In your case, we'll start off easy and say one million duckets would make and <em>okay</em> retirement. How we make money is also simple: buy low and sell high. It's not trigonometry! However, its not all that you would think. Luck plays a part, and life on the open water -- how shall we say? -- has it's <em>ups</em>, and <em>downs!</em></p>
  <p>You begin the game in your home port of Athens, with {{player.duckets}} duckets in cash, a small ship, and a load of wheat. Sail from port to port, buying commodities where they are cheap and selling them where they are expensive.</p>
